  <h1>Turkey Capture</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Max. Thanksgiving is coming up, but there is one problem: Max and his family don’t have a turkey. They also don’t want to buy one.
Super randomly, turkeys come out at night for a reason. So Max’s family made a trap and waited for a turkey.
That night, a turkey was scared. It was almost Thanksgiving, and you know what that means for the turkey. Suddenly, the turkey saw something shiny. As he approached, he noticed something—it was food! So he ran as fast as he could, like a cheetah.
The food was inside a box. The only thing blocking him from the food was a stick. It was heavy, but he pushed with all his might and was able to knock the stick away.
BANG! The turkey heard a noise, but he didn’t care. After he ate his food, he turned to leave—but there was a wall blocking him from escaping.
The next morning, Max came to the box and carried it into the house, because if he opened it outside, the turkey would escape. After they cooked the turkey, they ate a happy dinner.
They all agreed on two things:

They were thankful for the turkey.

They were thankful for each other.

The End </p>
