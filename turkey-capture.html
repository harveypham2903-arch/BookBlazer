  <h1>Turkey Capture</h1>
  <p> Hi my name is Max. Thankgiving is coming' up, but there is one. Max and his family don't have a turkey.
  They also DON'T  want to buy one. Super random, turkeys come out at night for reason. So Max's family made a trap,
  and wait for the turkey. That night, a turkey was scared. It was almost thankgiving. You know what that means
  for the turkey. Suddenly the turkey so saw shiny. As he approach, he notice somthing. It was his food! So he run as he
  he can like a cheetah. His food was inside the box. Now the only thing that block him and his food was a stick. 
  It was heavy, so he pushed with all his might. He was able to push the stick away. *BANG* The turkey heard something,
  but he didn't care. After the eat his food, he turned to leave. But there was a wall blocking him from leaving. 
  The next morning... Max come to the box and carry it into the house because if he open it now, the turkey will exscape.
  After they cook the turkey, they eat a happy dinney. They all argreed on 2 things. 1 They are thankfuls for the turkey.
  2 They are thankeful for each other. The End </p>
